# - XercesC(Cadfael) CMake Versioning File for External Projects
# This file is configured by Cadfael's XercesC port for use with CMake's 
# find_package in Config mode.
# It enables external projects to determine the version of XercesC found.
# More importantly, it allows that command to automatically determine 
# whether the found install is compatible with any VERSION that was 
# supplied with find_package.
#
# As this file is configured by XercesC(Cadfael) port system it SHOULD NOT 
# BE EDITED
#

# Installed Version as set from CMake

# Check whether the requested PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION is compatible with this
# installed version.
